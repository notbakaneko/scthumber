# scthumber

A node.js image thumbnailing daemon utilizing [Smartcrop.js](https://github.com/jwagner/smartcrop.js/) for content-aware cropping with [vips](http://www.vips.ecs.soton.ac.uk/) (via [sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp)) for resizing+processing.

Originally forked from [connect-thumbs](https://github.com/inadarei/connect-thumbs) but has since gone in a different direction.

(This is one of those ugly proof-of-concepts that ended up in production somehow.)

### Installing Dependencies

smartcrop.js
sharp

On a Debian/Ubuntu system:
```
npm ci --no-optional # or yarn --frozen-lockfile
