# scthumber

A node.js image thumbnailing daemon utilizing [Smartcrop.js](https://github.com/jwagner/smartcrop.js/) for content-aware cropping with [vips](http://www.vips.ecs.soton.ac.uk/) (via [sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp)) for resizing+processing.

Originally forked from [connect-thumbs](https://github.com/inadarei/connect-thumbs) but has since gone in a different direction.

(This is one of those ugly proof-of-concepts that ended up in production somehow.)

### Installing Dependencies

scthumber is dependent on:
smartcrop.js
sharp

On a Debian/Ubuntu system:

    npm ci --no-optional # or yarn --frozen-lockfile


## Configuration
See `const thumber` in `scthumbd.js` for now...

## Running

    npm run scthumbd



## Envrionment variables

`PORT` - listening port, defaults to 4001.

`WORKERS` - number of worker processes to spawn, defaults to number of cpus detected.


## Docker

The entire Docker section assumes:
- Docker Compose V2 is used - replace `docker compose` with `docker-compose` if using Docker Compose V1.
- using Docker Desktop - there may be differences in the base host image and how container networking is exposed with non-Desktop Docker or other container runtimes.

To just build an image:

    docker build -t <repository_name>:<tag> .


### Development

The Docker Compose configuration is provided for development convenience. Usage for production or combination with other projects is outside the scope of the provided configuration.

Running for development:

    docker compose up

will mount the local directory to the container; code changes will be reflected when the container is restarted.
The container will accept requests on port 4001. To use a different port, provide a `HTTP_PORT` env, e.g.:

    HTTP_PORT=8001 docker compose up

To override settings inside the container such as the number of workers or listening port, it is recommended to create use the `docker-compose.override.yml` file with the extra settings. Docker will automatically apply and merge settings from the override file when running `docker compose`.

### node_modules

The `node_modules` used are not platform binary compatible - `node_modules` in the container will be mounted to a volume to limit it to the container by default.

While working in the container, dependencies should be updated via `docker compose run`

    docker compose run --rm http npm ci --no-optional

If you want to use the local `node_modules`, you can override the existing volume mount:

    ./node_modules:/app/node_modules


### Networking Notes

This assumes the default Docker Desktop bridge networking is used and the remote host is accessible through the bridge network; different networking modes and container runtimes may require different configuration.

scthumber needs to be able to download the image source for thumbnailing.
When using a custom internal domain, you may need to add a mapping to the container to resolve.

e.g. If `osu-web.test` resolves to `127.0.0.1` on the host, it will also resolve to `127.0.0.1` in the container

Getting the host IP address on the container's network:

    docker compose run --rm http /bin/sh -c 'echo "$(getent hosts host.docker.internal)"' | awk '{ print $1 }'


If using `docker compose`, configure `extra_hosts` in a `docker-compose.override.yml` file with the format `<hostname>:<ip>`.

If using `docker run`, use the `--add-host` flag:

    docker run --add-host=<hostname>:<ip> --rm scthumber
